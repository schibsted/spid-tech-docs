{:id :user
 :name "User"
 :description "The user object is based on the [portable contacts
specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-smarr-vcarddav-portable-contacts-00). It is extended with
some custom fields. `userId` is an integer and represents the unique user ID, while
`id` is a legacy uuid and should be ignored in new integrations. The `uuid` is also a user identifier,
which is is globally unique and should therefore be the preferred identifier for a user.
The `email` and `phoneNumber` fields will always contain the primary used for both if available.
The corresponding *Verified fields are the date of the last time those were
verified.

When requesting a user that is not connected to the authorized client, only
public profile data will be available:

* `id`
* `userId`
* `uuid`
* `status`
* `displayName`
* `name`
* `gender`
* `preferredUsername`
* `utcOffset`
* `published`
* `updated`
* `lastLoggedIn`
* `locale`
* `tracking`

 :description "Voucher groups are templates from which [vouchers](/types/voucher/) can be
generated. Individual vouchers are not complete on their own - you need a
voucher's group to fully identify its functionality. Voucher groups may have
several limitations, like how many vouchers can be generated (for unique one-off
vouchers), or how many times a shared voucher (same code used many times) may be
used.

Two vouchers are supported: Giveaway and Campaign. Giveaway voucher groups are
connected to a product and redeeming a voucher from this group will create a
subscription or grant digital content access. The campaign version is used in
connection to Campaigns that require vouchers to be activated in the purchase
flow."

 :description "Campaigns are groups of products that may be given new prices
when purchased through the campaign. For a campaign to be applied to a purchase,
itâ€™s `campaignId` needs to be part of the purchase URL. Campaigns may have
limitations on their availability in time (start and stop dates), count (ie how
many times it has been used), voucher (requires a valid voucher code to use) or
address (the user must supply a physical address in order to use it).

Although campaigns are intended for temporary special offers, they may also be
used as permanent way of getting lists of products. For this use case one has to
be aware that the `newPrice` of campaign products does not update automatically
if the product price is updated."

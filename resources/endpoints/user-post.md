:introduction

Create a new user. Not available for mobile clients, for historical reasons.
See the [signup endpoint](/endpoints/POST/signup/).

The email is globally unique in Schibsted account, and there can only be
one account associated with any given email address. To query for the
availability of an email address, see the
[email status endpoint](/endpoints/GET/email/{email}/status/).

If a password is not provided, one will be generated by the system and emailed
to the user. All passwords are stored fully encrypted, thus user-provided
passwords can never be communicated in clear-text.

Only an available email address is required to create a Schibsted account. The
additional parameters that can be provided may also be filled in by the user in
their Schibsted account profile at any later point.

:introduction

This endpoint generates an unique token (5 minutes of expiration time) sent to user's e-mail, that allows user to log-in to SchAcc without providing his/hers credentials.
 
* Only one token per user can be active at one time.
* User doesn't have to be previously registered at SchAcc.

You can further improve user's experience by setting context of token e-mail & confirmation page by providing a Client information.

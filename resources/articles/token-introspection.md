## Prerequisites

In order to make use of this information, you need to know your:

- client ID
- client secret

As a resource server publishing APIs protected by OAuth, you need to verify the tokens
received from clients. For JWT access tokens issued by Schibsted account, this can be done in two ways:

1. By a request to Schibsted account's introspection endpoint `/oauth/introspect`.
1. By verifying the token signature and content locally.

**Note:** Non-JWT tokens can not be introspected. Make sure JWT tokens are enabled for the client in Self Service.

**Note:** User tokens can not be introspected locally. Only remote introspection via a token introspection request
to Schibsted account is currently supported.

## Token introspection request

The introspection endpoint is protected by the same [client authentication](/authentication/#client-authentication) as
the token endpoint. A resource server is only allowed to introspect tokens which are intended for itself, or for another
client belonging to the same merchant.

To allow a resource server to introspect a token issued to a client not belonging to the same merchant as the resource
server, the client must make sure to [specify a "resource indicator" in the token request](/authentication/).

```sh
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Basic NGU4NDYzNTY5Y2FmN2NhMDE5MDAwMDA3OmZvb2Jhcg"\
                     -d token=<access token>
                     https://identity-pre.schibsted.com/oauth/introspect
```

When successful, this request will return a JSON object:

```json
{
  "active": true,
  "scope": "profile email",
  "client_id": "4e8463569caf7ca019000007",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "exp": 1487169930,
  "now": 1487166577
}
```

For further details refer to
[OAuth 2.0 Token Introspection](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7662).


## Local token introspection

The JWT access token is signed asymmetrically, and Schibsted account publishes the set of valid public keys at the
endpoint `/oauth/jwks`, e.g. https://identity-pre.schibsted.com/oauth/jwks.

To verify the token locally, follow these steps:

1. Fetch the [JSON Web Key Set (JWKS)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7517#section-5) containing all valid keys from 
   Schibsted account `/oauth/jwks`.
1. Look at the JWS header to find the key id in the [`kid` parameter](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7515#section-4.1.4).
1. Find the key with the matching key id in the JWKS, and use it to 
   [verify the signature of the JWT token](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7515#section-5.2).
1. Verify that the claims in the payload match what you expect (the correct scope, audience, etc.).


A list of libraries in different programming languages that implements JWS can be found on https://jwt.io.

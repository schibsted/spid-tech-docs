## Here we explain the usage and creation of agreements in SPiD.
Terms of Use allows cross-site autologin and a better governance enabling users to accept Terms of Use only once across all devices. The Terms of Use are set on a merchant level in Self Service.

## When implementing SPiD
Each user facing API client must have terms of use in place before going into production. Here are the most important steps you need to take into account when working with your SPiD implementation.
1. Draft your terms of use. 
2. Privacy office must approve terms of use and privacy-/cookie policy before publishing. Send them to privacy@schibsted.com for approval.
3. Publish your terms when approved by Schibsted Privacy Office.

## Schibsted Group Legal
If you need help to formulate the terms of use and privacy-/cookie policy, you can send them to the Legal department.

Schibsted account supports server-side callbacks that enable your service to
subscribe to changes in data. Your service can then cache data and receive
updates, rather than continuously poll Schibsted account's servers. Caching data and using
this API can improve the reliability of your app or service and decrease its
load times.

Whenever a subscribed change occurs, Schibsted account makes an HTTP POST request to a
callback URL of your choice, with a list of changes. Your app will generally
receive notification of the change within a couple of minutes of its occurrence.

<div class="mod warning">

      Please ensure that your callback endpoints are accessible by Schibsted account through your
      firewalls and that errors generated by the your callback endpoint are monitored
      and handled.

## Types of callbacks

Schibsted account currently supports two kinds of callbacks:

* User status changes

## Callback requests

When an object changes, an HTTP POST request will be made to the client-defined
callback URL. The response body will contain
[Base64 URL encoded](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64#URL_applications) text
signed with your signature secret.

**Note**: The content-type of the `POST` request made by Schibsted account is `"text/plain"`.

**NOTE**: Your signature secret is **not** the same as your client secret (which
is used for authentication). It is a different secret specifically used for
signing requests and decoding signed responses. If you do not have a signing
secret, [contact Schibsted account](mailto:schibstedaccount@schibsted.com).

The response body contains an encoded signature and encoded data, separated by a
dot, e.g. `"<signature>.<data>"`. Here is an example:

```
GTUVPjN1LzdyU1qwHjnMKS2oNx.eyJvYmplY3QiOiJvcmRlciIsImVudHJ5IjpbeyJvcmRlcl9pZCI6IjMwMDAxNCIsI
```

The decoded data is a JSON object:

```js
{
  "object": "user",
  "algorithm": "HMAC-SHA256",
  "entry": [
      {
          "userId": 123,
          "changedFields": "status",
          "time": "2012-10-19 10:10:15"
      },
      {
          "userId": 456,
          "changedFields": "status",
          "time": "2012-10-19 10:10:19"
      }
   ]
}
```

### Decoding responses

# :tabs

## :tab PHP

The following example manually parses and verifies the signature of the request:

```php
<?php
function parse_signed_request($signed_request, $secret) {
  list($encoded_sig, $payload) = explode('.', $signed_request, 2);
  $sig = base64_url_decode($encoded_sig);
  $data = base64_url_decode($payload);
  $expected_sig = hash_hmac('sha256', $payload, $secret, $raw = true);
  if (!hash_equals($sig, $expected_sig)) {
    return null;
  }
  return $data;
};

function base64_url_decode($input) {
  return base64_decode(strtr($input, '-_', '+/'));
}

$payload = file_get_contents("php://input");
$parsed = parse_signed_request($payload, $client_sign_secret);
$data = json_decode($parsed, true);
```

## :tab Java

The following example manually parses and verifies the signature of the request:

```java
byte[] signature = base64UrlDecode(request.split("\\.")[0]);
byte[] payload = base64UrlDecode(request.split("\\.")[1]);
byte[] expectedSignature = null;

try {
    SecretKeySpec sks = new SecretKeySpec(signSecret.getBytes("UTF-8"), "HmacSHA256");
    Mac mac = Mac.getInstance("HmacSHA256");
    mac.init(sks);
    expectedSignature = mac.doFinal(payload.getBytes("UTF-8"));
} catch (NoSuchAlgorithmException | InvalidKeyException | UnsupportedEncodingException ex) {
    throw ex;
}

if (!MessageDigest.isEqual(expectedSignature, signature)) {
    throw new SpidApiException("Signature is not valid!");
}
```

### Processing callback data

The response only contains a description of what changes occurred - it does not
inline individual resources. Having received, decoded and verified the integrity
of callback data, the client should iterate through all the `entry` objects and
retrieve up-to-date objects through relevant endpoints. These objects can be
safely cached until the next callback request is made.

Schibsted account aggregates changes and sends batched updates every five minutes. This means
that for every subscription, you will receive at most one request every five
minutes, and possible less often (if there are fewer changes).

## Callback responses

When your client receives callback requests, it should respond with
HTTP code `202 Accepted`. If the callback does not respond with `202`,
Schibsted account will retry again immediately, and then four more times at
increasing intervals over the subsequent 25 hours. If all of these
requests go un-accepted, the callback request will be marked as
failed.

Retries occur after five minutes, fifteen minutes, one hour, twelve hours and
again twelve hours. There is a thirty second timeout before Schibsted account quits the
connection and considers the request failed. *Do not synchronously process
callback data before responding to the callback request.*

## User status callback

This callback will inform the client when a user's status changes.

##Guardian

When checking access on a product that is of the type "Digital Content", a user normally
has access if they own that product or it's parent. If the reverse is needed, the parent
"Digital Content" can be flagged as a "Guardian" (think legal guardian of children, the child
is the owner, but the control is on the guardian).

If access is checked on a product that is of the type "Digital Content" and is flagged as
a "Guardian", then the user has access if they own that product, or any of it's children.

There is currently no API or Ambassador access to this feature, it has to be directly ordered
from SchAcc by clients that whish to take advantage of it.

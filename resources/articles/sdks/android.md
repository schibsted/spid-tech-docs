The recommended way to use the SDK is to implement the UI module. This is highly customizable and will give you 
complete UIs out of the box. To learn more about the SDK, please refer to the
[published documentation](https://schibsted.github.io/account-sdk-android/).

For support, please contact [schibstedaccount@schibsted.com](mailto:schibstedaccount@schibsted.com)


## Getting started
To get started with the SDK, you'll need to request access to Schibsted account before you can start using it.
This process is documented [here](https://techdocs.spid.no/selfservice/access/). 

Once you have access and have created your client so that you have your client ID and secret, you should head over to
read [the documentation](https://schibsted.github.io/account-sdk-android/).

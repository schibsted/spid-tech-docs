**Note: this documentation is for the upcoming version 3.x of the JavaScript SDK. The old 2.x
version can be found [here](/sdks/javascript-2x/).**

The JavaScript SDK is different from the other SDKs in that it only provides information about the
user's authentication/authorization status. It is not a general purpose SDK to make arbitrary
requests against the API. A [Node SDK](https://github.schibsted.io/spt-identity/spid-sdk-node) is
being developed to fill this role for server-side JavaScript.

To get started implementing this SDK, please visit our [documentation on
Github](https://pages.github.schibsted.io/spt-identity/spid-sdk-browser)

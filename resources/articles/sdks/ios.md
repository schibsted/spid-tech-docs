The iOS SDK simplifies connecting to Schibsted Account. To learn more about the SDK, the full documentation can be found
[here](https://schibsted.github.io/account-sdk-ios/).

For support, please contact [schibstedaccount@schibsted.com](mailto:schibstedaccount@schibsted.com)

## Getting started
To get started with the SDK, you'll need to
[request access to Schibsted account](https://techdocs.spid.no/selfservice/access/) before you can start using it.

Once you have access and have created your client so that you have your client ID and secret, you should head over to
read [the documentation](https://schibsted.github.io/account-sdk-ios/).

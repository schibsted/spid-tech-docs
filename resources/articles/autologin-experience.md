If you’ve integrated the JavaScript SDK on your website, you can give returning users a streamlined login experience. 
People won’t have to see the logged-out version of your site and won’t waste time signing-in. By automatically 
determining if a user is signed-in to SPiD via the JavaScript SDK, you can let returning users immediately start 
engaging with your site.

SPiD platform (blue):

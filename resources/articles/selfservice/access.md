Our self service tool gives developers control over their SPiD API client implementation.

## In Self Service you will be able to manage your client settings such as:
- Create API clients
- Add/edit redirect urls
- Manage Ambassador user management access

## In order to access Self Service

You will need to register your work e-mail as a SPiD user on the environment you will work on:
<table class="sectioned mbl" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <th>Environment</th>
    <th>URL</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Stage/Pre</td>
    <td><a href="https://identity-pre.schibsted.com/">https://identity-pre.schibsted.com/</a></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Production Norway</td>
    <td><a href="https://payment.schibsted.no/">https://payment.schibsted.no/</a></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Production Sweden/International</td>
    <td><a href="https://login.schibsted.com/">https://login.schibsted.com/</a></td>
  </tr>
</table>

## If your company is new to SPiD (does not have a Merchant/Company registered)
Your project tech lead will need to send an e-mail to schibstedaccount@schibsted.com and request a that SPiD enables
merchant/company access with the information stating which client/s you need access to and the e-mail address registered.

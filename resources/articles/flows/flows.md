SPiD flows are separated into different flows, that can be trigged by you by using different urls.
The login flow for instance, is triggered with an url path starting with /flow/login or /flow/auth.

## Intro
We developed our new flow engine to

* reduce redirects in the login flow,
* update design, to reduce the SPiD branding,
* give more control to the client over design,
* and to make it more maintainable and extendable by us in development.

## How it looks
During the development of the new flows, we worked with a prototype, that we've made available to you.
It can be used to get a sense of how it looks and works, and give you an idea how you can style the flow yourself.
This prototype is available at http://preview.spid.se. Each row is a variant of a flow found in SPiD.

## Customization
Customization to the design can be made in Self Service. You are able to edit

* background color and text color outside the frame,
* the teaser view to the left,
* and the text shown below the login box.

If you do not configure a teaser, you will get a slimmed down view throughout the whole flow, which looks like this
